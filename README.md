# Assignment
I already have a little knowledge working with 16*2 lcd interfacing with arduino using I2C protocol. And also I have done a small task(project) for taking the inputs from serial monitor.
As I already know those, I directly jumped into wroking with SSD1306. I first learnt about it and then starting developing the code required.
Even I have learnt about the GFX in this process.
I started the project 08-06-2021 at 12:00 and completed on 08-06-2021 at 20:47.
